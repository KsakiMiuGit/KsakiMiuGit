-  Hi, I’m @KsakiMiuGit. My name is Karolina Baumert. I'm junior backend developer with a passion for software creation and development in .NET technologies and Python.
-  I’m interested in creating applications in .NET, object-oriented programming, algorithms and AI. 
-  I’m currently learning effective programming in C# and Python, managing databases using SQL and NoSQL, design principles and how machine learning works.
-  I’m excited to connect with organizations seeking .Net or Python backend developer and am looking forward to contributing to innovative projects. I'm open to development, teamwork and learning new skill.
-  Outside of work I'm intrested in handicrafts such as drawing, reading books, taking care of my plants and pet. In free time, I play computer games or go for a walk in forest.
